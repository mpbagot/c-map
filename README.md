# C-MAP - Character Manipulation Animation Program

C-MAP is (will be) a complete animation suite designed to allow visual novel developers to animate their game's characters with ease, without creating complex 3D models.

The software will be designed with many similar features to the well-known E-Mote system, but will forever remain free and open source.

### Building from Source

Currently, C-MAP is incomplete and so no compiled releases are available. As development progresses, this shall change and the recommended method for running C-MAP will be to use the compiled binaries.

For those who wish to compile from source, run the following commands in a terminal emulator of choice:
```bash
 make
```
