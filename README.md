# C-MAP - Character Manipulation Animation Program

C-MAP is (will be) a complete animation suite designed to allow visual novel developers to animate their game's characters with ease, without creating complex 3D models.

The software will be designed with many similar features to the well-known E-Mote system, but will forever remain free and open source.
